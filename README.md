# Dogs - Social Network

## 🌐 Description

"Dogs" is a unique social network exclusively for our four-legged best friends. It's an innovative platform that allows dog lovers and owners to share photos of their adorable pets, follow other users, and interact through comments. It was developed during the "Complete React" course from Origamid.com. The teacher provided both the design files and API.

Like Instagram, but purely for dogs, users can create an account, post pictures of their canines, and get statistical analysis of their posts. The platform has a dedicated page for users to check their posts and another one for statistics, which uses the React "Victory" charts library for data visualization. Users can also explore and comment on other users' posts, fostering a vibrant and interactive community.

Api resets periodically, so don't expect your account or posts to remain...
